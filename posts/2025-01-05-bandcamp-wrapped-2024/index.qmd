Every December, Spotify rewards us for submitting to the algorithm 
by telling us what we listened to all year,
as you know if you are not a boomer.
Geriatric millenials know it, even infantile Xennials like me know it. 
This lets us wave a badge of pride on social media: 
"Yes, I am in the top 1% of Gwar fans."
("Top 0.001% of Melt Banana fans"? Whatever, insert a reference to a relatively niche band 
that you haven't thought about in a while so it strikes you as funny.)

I barely Spotify. My Wrapped was "You listened to 

In this post I'm sharing music I bought on Bandcamp in 2024.

First, some prelude, for context.

I am a huge music fan.
I also am painfully aware that the tech industry I work in has really changed how musicians make money.
It used to be that record companies could support a relatively broad base of musicians, 
as long as those musicians helped them sell enough sounds etched into highly processed dinosaur bones (records).
Now we have replaced that system with a new system where tech overlords support a much narrower base of musicians, 
basically by accident, since they pay only thousandths of a penny every time a song gets streamed.
I think somebody wrote a pretty good song about it once.

(You can't read the rest of this blog post until you sit through the whole song. My blog, my rules :sunglasses:)

Ok, the angry tech bros of the broligarchy are telling themselves I'm just virtue-signaling with this 
opening paragraph.
Of course the right fix for this is to not actually change the system, 
but instead to make each person feel like they alone are personally responsible for fixing everything.
And that is why, whenever I can, I pay for music for Bandcamp.
Individualism! Exceptionalism! Americanism! 
My strategy worked perfectly fine until Bandcamp was acquired by Epic Games, 
and then by Songtradr, 
who [layed off half the staff](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/17/bandcamp-lays-off-half-its-staff-after-buyout-by-songtradr).
So much for "championing independent artists".
So much for personally fixing everything.

The last thing I'll say about this before I actually write about music is that I have seen a couple of attempts to 
build worker-owned platforms.
In principle, I am totally in favor of this.
We do not need these fucking scumbags, and the sooner we realize it the better.
In practice, there's some complicated economics thing that goes on when you have multiple teams running on a shoelace that are all trying to replace 
the thing run by our feudal techlords who have infinite money to fend them off.
Someone who is smarter than me made this great website that captures the alternatives: https://bandcampalternative.com/

My good friend Alex Chabot LeClerc also happens to be really into music,
and posts about it weekly on his blog:
https://alexchabot.net/categories/music/
He shares Spotify links, and that works great (I will begrudgingly admit that there are good things about tech), 
but he also knows that I live on Bandcamp,

And that's also why he shared this cool blog post with me from Mac Wright, on how to generate a Bandcamp wrapped.
https://macwright.com/2024/12/06/bandcamp-wrapped.html

The actual tool is here:
https://tmcw-bandcampwrapped.web.val.run/

I did as the tool instructs, copying and pasting my purchases over the last year.
Instead of just dumping everything, I will write a little bit about the music I've been into over the last year, 
and how I found it. I hope you will forgive me this bit of self-reflection.

## French Canadians

Since Alex inspired this post, I will start with music I bought from Canada this year.

He introduced me to Bleu Jeans Bleu a couple of years ago.
Primo quality rock/pop with a distinctly Quebecois flair.

See for example,

Alex told me one of their songs perfectly captures the feeling of being for him.

The L'appartment album I found while in Maine for the NMAC 2024 conference.
I was sitting in the parking lot of the hotel the conference was at, 
and this song came on the radio, 
on this French Canadian station I had managed to pick up.
It was just a very nice vibe, made even more nice by the slight patina of static from the almost out of range station.
I loved the song so much I ran inside to google and try and figure out what station it must be, so I could see if they had a playlist.
Like a total weirdo I was even asking people at the conference I knew who happend to be from Canada if they knew of the stations.
No, what is wrong with you.
I found the station anyway and they did have a playlist.

I liked the band so much I had to ask Alex if he knew of them; he did not, but the name rang a bell, and in fact this musician is the son of another musician Alex is familiar with.
Not surprisingly, Alex suggested some other musicians in the same vein, like Amelie Fortin.
And then later in the year he happened to recommend Galaxie, that definitely hit that alternative rock spot in a way I haven't heard in a while.


## spacemusic, ambient, electronica

I have been into ambient for a while.
Like a lot of people, I was unwittingly turned on to Japanese ambient during the pandemic, thanks to the YouTube algorithm.
See this article on ars technica: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/how-old-ambient-japanese-music-became-a-smash-hit-on-youtube/
(I like a lot of the related music namechecked in this article that was also mysteriously promoted by the YouTube algorithm, 
like 1979 from Deru, Plant Music, and An Empty Bliss Beyond this World by the Caretaker)
That made me get back into Brian Eno more deeply and then just sort of embrace ambient more generally, 
even though the failed musician in me can feel the ghost of Frank Zappa silently seething at wallpaper music.
Man, I get it, you were a super-genius composer, but people are allowed to like wallpaper. 
Looking back over this year, The Algorithm has continued to turn me on to a lot of other ambient, but more into the genre of [spacemusic]().
Somehow this fits with me continuing to dwell in the post-apocalpytic, since I played a lot of [Caves of Qud]() this year
and I re-read the first book of the [Southern Reach Trilogy]().

</div>

Both Steve Brenner and Tim Stebbing I think are UK artists who got their start in the ~70s.
I found them through YouTube channels like Sounds of the Dawn, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27UWFg6Nxd8) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oWO4eB3YbM).
Brenner has directly sent me an email every time I've purchased from him.
This is the kind of personal touch you don't get when you stream music through a Platform.

#### American Primitive

Ok, there's only one group in this category, the Nightcrawlers, but I love them, and I wish I could pay them more for all of their music.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 10px;">
<div><a href="https://thenightcrawlerspa.bandcamp.com/album/the-biophonic-boombox-recordings"><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2111723000_2.jpg" alt=""></a><a href="https://thenightcrawlerspa.bandcamp.com/album/the-biophonic-boombox-recordings"><strong>The Biophonic Boombox Recordings</strong><span> by The Nightcrawlers</span></a></div>
</div>

I found them through this channel

but as that person kindly pointed out there's actually another channel with a whole playlist.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?si=NfXdndRHmoVJ4AMG&amp;list=PLmHXYk0FPToBWd5fjDmkyd0NOWlAiBZxd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

What I really love about their albums are the art, clearly made on some 80s graphic design software like Printshop, but somehow managing to look mystical at the same time.
(Scroll through the playlist to see.)
Mysticisim in the same way that I think Robert Pollard's lyrics about UFOs and his collage album covers are, at their best, mystical.

### Modular?

I will lump together Young Scientist and Sines of Modular Pleasure into a totally-made up genre I'll call "80s american ambient".
There's no over themes of space per se.
Of course I have to like a group named Young Scientist. I'm no longer so young but they really have made scientist soundtrack music,
for those late hours in the lab.

</div>

There's some question of whether Sines of Modular Pleasure are even real.
Check out this maniac's blog post: https://ivandsm.github.io/2022/12/04/on-sines-of-exquisite-pleasure.html
(Maniac in a good way, thank you for your work, whoever you are/)
Based on their latest release, I think they are indeed more of an homage. 
It still works for me, and I would still lump it into this category of "American suburban guys who wanted to be Brian Eno but had to re-invent the genre"

#### Cube of the Unknowing

Yet another YouTube find.

Again, as a scientist who would like to resist all the worst aspects of reductionism, how am I not going to like an album called Ghost Circuits of Menlo Park?

</div>

## Electronica

### Hotel Pools

Hotel Pools is another artist I found during the pandemic.
This was my running music, when I would do my routes through Rock Creek Park in DC.
It's perfect for that. Just total shut-off-worry-noise-thoughts music.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 10px;">

</div>

### Home

Yet another group I found through YouTube, this time as the first song on this random playlist that features a mecha-Bart Simpson as the image with a trippy bad VR background.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/utkEqw2GJo4?si=twASTQIY56hTZQ7K" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You're telling me that you do not feel goosebumps all over your body, as if a your soul became a laser beam shooting out of God's forehead, 
at the very momenet you hear *that* song, with the mecha Bart and the cyberpunk background undulating behind? 
You, sir, have no soul.

Turns out all their other shit is really good too.

### Aroo Jaftab

I heard this artist open for Khruangbin went I went with my partner to see them at Anthem DC.
I love the microtonal melodies that she sings, that remind me of some Iranian music.
She is also just clearly a true artist and poet. Thank God, we need more such people in the world.
