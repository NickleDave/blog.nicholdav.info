Update 2026-02-20:
I broke this post up into two posts, one here and [one on the VocalPy developer's blog](https://blog.vocalpy.org/posts/2025-12-19-domain-driven-design/), 
based on feedback from folks in the [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/) and [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/) communities: 
[Ben Fulton](https://fosstodon.org/@benfulton), [Hector Correa](https://hectorcorrea.com/about), 
[Kris Armeni](https://www.kristijanarmeni.net/) and [Warrick Ball](https://warrickball.gitlab.io/),
and [Felipe Moreno](https://flpm.dev/).
Special thanks to [Alex Chabot-Leclerc](https://alexchabot.net/) for reading closely and talking through earlier versions of these posts.

In this post I hope to convince you that you should care about domain-driven design.
It falls into the category of "me writing about how my thinking has evolved about research and software". 

You might read about domain-driven design and think 
"I already do this. Why do I need to name it and formalize it?"
I am not claiming this is a radical new idea. 
What I hope to convince you of is that, sure, domain-driven design is just as obvious as it sounds, 
but you should be thinking about it more anyways.

So: first I'll [introduce domain driven design](#what-is-domain-driven-design), 
then I'll explain why [I think it's worth thinking about it more, even if you think it's something you already do](#domain-driven-design-is-not-new).

## What is domain-driven design? {#what-is-domain-driven-design}

First, let me introduce domain-driven design, and tell you why you might care about it.
Sometime in 2022-2023, I read 
[Domain-Driven Design](https://www.domainlanguage.com/ddd/) by Eric Evans, and I got really excited about it.
If you do nothing else, read the first chapter of Evans' book, where he relates the story 
of how he worked with some electrical engineers to design software they would use to 
design printed circuit boards (AKA PCBs). 

At the beginning, he makes mistakes.
He tries to understand their jargon word-for-word.
Then he asks them to specify in detail what they think the software should do.
Neither of those approaches were ever going to work well. 
Finally he hits upon the idea of asking them to draw out diagrams of their process 
and how the software should interact with it.
These are simple, rough box and arrow sketches as he shows.

![evans figure 1.2](evans-2003-fig1.2.png)

Notice what is happening here: this is not just a developer creating a UML diagram to show to other developers. 
This is software engineers and domain experts developing a pidgin language together. 
They use this pidgin to talk about the domain problem they are trying to solve with software.

It's an interesting story for a couple of reasons. First of all, you have a feeling that he is 
almost an anthropologist, going into this unfamiliar tribe of electrical engineers 
so he can learn their culture.
I think this is a familiar feeling for anyone who has tried to translate 
some real-world domain into software, even if it's part of a culture they feel like they belong to.
Second, you really get a feel for his process. 

If you have ever gone through the process of designing software for some real-world domain, 
I bet the story really resonates with you.
Or, you know what?
I'll dare to say that, even if you have only ever written nerdy software tools 
for the domain of other software nerds, 
you still might find that the story resonates with you. 
Software engineering is a domain, after all.
(I'll return to this point below.)

At this point, you might be thinking, "write code in terms of your domain, yeah, sure, everybody does that".
I got really excited reading this stuff, and told people about it at the job I had at the time.
I made a big deal of presenting parts of the book, 
and talking about how we could use this approach for what we were working on.
And I got this very underwhelmed response of 
"Yeah, we sort of already do that. Aren't you just describing object-oriented programming?"
Yes, but no! I'll come back to the "no, we aren't doing that" below, but first, the yes.
We should realize this is what we're already doing and be very explicit about it!
The domain should be at the front of our mind at all times, 
and we only should be iterating on the design of our software 
insofar as it relates to the domain!

Now, the "but no": domain-driven development isn't just thinking about the domain. 
Yes, we all think of the domain when we write our code,
more or less subconsciously. 
But Evans advocates for a specific *development* process.
He says this process is required for his approach to design to work.
He sees it as a form of extreme or Agile programming.
If you're not familiar with those, 
the important thing to know here that they are more iterative 
than previous approaches, that focused on 
"elaborate development methodologies that burden projects with useless, 
static documents and obsessive upfront planning and design", as Evans puts it.
Instead, he focuses on writing code that has a bare bones implementation 
he can test right away. "Development is iterative." 
Of course, this is one place where Python, my main programming language, shines.
It's really easy to iterate interactively in a Jupyter notebook 
with a bare-bones implementation of your sketch of an API.
Of course, later you should do some proper engineering instead of living in Jupyter notebooks, 
so you don't have to worry about someone 
giving a [preachy conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U) 
that condemns you for your naughty programming practices.

Evans' other requirement for the development process is that 
"[d]evelopers and domain experts have a close relationship."
If you are a researcher who programs, 
well, hopefully you already have a close relationship with yourself.
And with your collaborators and colleagues.
This second requirement naturally gives rise to one of the key ideas from the book, 
that of *ubiquitous language*.
This is what I called a pidgin above. It's a language that the domain experts and software developers 
arrive at together through the iterative process of development.
The words in this ubiquitous language correspond to key concepts in the domain that the software needs to capture, 
the things that developers and domain-experts realize they should focus on, as they iterate.
Ubiquitous language "embeds domain terminology in the software systems we build", 
as Martin Fowler puts it in [this post](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html). 
It's this continous process of developer and domain expert iterating together that really appeals to me.

## Domain-driven design is not new, and you should think about it more anyway {#domain-driven-design-is-not-new}

Ok, so now let me circle back around, talk about why, sure, domain-driven design is not a new idea 
(as Evans himself acknowledges right at the start of his book), 
and why you should be doing it, or doing even more of it. 
This is where I come back to the "no" part of "Do we already do this? Yes and no." 
As you can tell, I've gotten this reaction before: "so, yeah, we already do that".

Let me reiterate, I know these ideas are not new.
I now know for sure they've been around longer than Eric Evans' book,
because I have been attempting to read yet another book, 
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs), AKA, SICP.
I ended up finding domain-driven design in SICP, 
and having to admit to myself that, yeah, this idea has been around forever.
When I got to chapters 2 and 3, 
there I saw that we were talking about data abstraction 
and designing programs for modeling. Sound familiar?
Let me quote you this bit from chapter 3:

> One powerful design strategy, which is particularly appropriate to the construction of programs 
for modeling physical systems, is to base the structure of our programs on the structure of the system being modeled. 
For each object in the system, we construct a corresponding computational object. For each system action, 
we define a symbolic operation in our computational model. 
Our hope in using this strategy is that extending the model to accommodate new objects or new actions 
will require no strategic changes to the program, only the addition 
of the new symbolic analogs of those objects or actions. 
If we have been successful in our system organization, 
then to add a new feature or debug an old one we will have to work on only a localized part of the system.

Well there it is, domain-driven design in a nutshell.

I hate to end on an appeal to authority, 
but I feel like, if a book as venerable and time-honored as SICP talks about domain-driven design, 
if the authors think it's worth discussing in the introductory sections of their chapters, 
then it *must* be an idea worth keeping in mind.
(Such is the state of computer science that I am calling a book that's less than half a century old "time-honored".)
I hope I've convinced you to think about domain-driven design just a little more.

## Addendum: domain-driven design and coding LLMs

I have to say that thinking about domain-driven design has also got me seeing overlap 
with ideas like [programming as theory building](https://cekrem.github.io/posts/programming-as-theory-building-naur/).
The whole point of that post is that

Likewise, for end users who don't want to care about computer science, 
they still need a way to formulate their ideas.
These notes from Jamie sum up why doing that via an LLM using natural language "prompts" is a bad idea:
https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/notes/a-small-matter-of-programming/

> In natural language interfaces, users have to learn the undocumented subset of their natural language that the machine understands correctly

and [domain-specific languages](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262140539/a-small-matter-of-programming/) 
as an alternative to magical, god-like AI "agents" that do all the intellectual heavy lifting for 
software developers (and anyone else who does any kind of creative thinking for a living). 
See this quote from the introduction to "A Small Matter of Programming" 
(the book I just linked to, that considers task-specific languages, among other things): 

![](small-matter-of-programming-screenshot.jpg){fig-alt="Screenshot of text from introduction. What interests me about these scenarios is not that they make fantastic, unrealistic promises (though I think they do), or that the instructions given by the user are couched in simple English (Tesler at least concedes that more structured languages may be needed), or that they embody such a grand vision (though the vision has much appeal). Rather, it is interesting that it is the programmer who is to control all of the computational magic. As Tesler says, programmers will endow computer-agents with their basic capabilities, even meeting such exciting challenges as programming the computer to know what users will think before they think it! By comparison, notice the relationship of the end user to the computer; the end user is engaged in the most humdrum activities: making queries regarding a phone conversation, asking the computer to set up an appointment, requesting articles from the library (Tesler, 1991). Now contrast this vision of the computer-agent with what Alan Kay (in the same issue of Scientific American) envisions for educational software: children writing simulations of complex natural phenomena such as biological and physical systems to better understand how they function. Kay's colleagues have created a simulation construction kit for children so that they can build their own simulations. The construction kit lets children write simple scripts that model animal behavior. Using the kit they can change parameters to see how changing conditions affect the animal. This use of computers is an instance of what Tesler called the personal implement: the children are doing nothing more or less than programming. With the kit, the children have tools that give them tremendous scope for intellectual exploration and personal empowerment."}

(Thank you to [Alistair Davidson](https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/contributor/alistair-davidson/) 
who I saw post about this book [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/moh-kohn.bsky.social/post/3m5ia4x543s2s), 
I'm recycling their screenshot and alt text.)
I think that ideas about software as the output of a human-driven, theory-based process 
put the lie to the notion that Large Language Model-driven development will end 
software engineering as we know it anytime soon. 
A coding LLM is just a statistical model of (programming) languages, 
"auto-complete on steroids". 
LLMs can't think, they can't theorize, 
no matter how many names you steal from cognitive science to give to the underlying math. 
Yes, as a (lapsed) cognitive scientist, I think ["chain of thought reasoning"](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking) 
is an offensive name for what is essentially Viterbi decoding with delusions of grandeur. 
But I'll save those thoughts for yet another blog post.
